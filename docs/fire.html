		<p>You swiftly unholster your blaster and dash to ambush the alien, and before it has the chance to even look at you, you aim and pull the trigger right behind its bulbous head. The blaster bolt rips straight through its metal skull, revealing the tapestry of wires woven inside. Sparks fly out from both ends of the blaster hole now filling its headspace, and it tips over with a loud clank.</p>
		<p>You gawk at it for a moment before crouching down to investigate. You lift up its limp arm and activate your suit's power-lifting module and bend its arm to crack it open. The green exoskin tears away and reveals the robotic components that make up the alien's interior. It wasn't even an alien to begin with.</p>
		<p>You stand back up to your feet and give the alien robot a soft kick. It definitely isn't coming back online in a productive capacity anytime soon, but it doesn't need to. Your kick activated an alarm that begins to shriek out from the robot. You kick it again in a panic to turn it off, but that only causes the siren to start blaring out from the beginning again.</p>
		<p>Behind you, you barely hear a set of doors opening and feel the vibrations of many footsteps clanking out onto the floor. You turn around to meet a small group of more robot aliens, peculiarly dressed like chefs. However, that isn't what's really caught your eye as you see that they're equipped with military-grade weaponry that could chew through your suit in nanoseconds. They start to aim their blasters at you, and you've only got about 2 seconds to make a move.</p>
