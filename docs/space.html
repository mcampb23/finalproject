		<p>Congratulations, cadet! You've recently graduated from the space naval academy and are on your way to becoming the greatest space ranger the final frontier has ever seen! But you're not quite there yet.</p>
		<p>Currently, you are an up-and-coming freelancer living in the far-flung future of 2015. You've just been sent out on your first mission since graduation by the leaders of your Moon colony. You've been tasked with investigating the sudden appearance of a previously untracked asteroid that's been caught in Earth's orbit. Scanners have detected that it's ripe with resources beyond anything an asteroid is normally capable of possessing... and it would be a waste not to capitalize on the opportunity.</p>
		<p>As you pilot your cruiser toward the coordinates, a small speck out in the distance grows larger as you get closer. The asteroid comes into view, and just when you think you're about to reach it, the space rock keeps getting bigger and bigger. As it turns out, this huge hunk of solid stone comes out to be about the size of a traditional space carrier, a fact which was not imparted to you by your superiors.</p>
		<p>You circle your spacecraft around the asteroid a few times to find a place to land, and you conveniently happen to spot a crevice oriented into the side of the rock that's about as big as a carrier's landing bay. You engage your ship's docking procedures and carefully set down within the port-sized port.</p>
		<p>You exit your spacecraft wearing your state-of-the-art, specially tailored spacesuit and equipped with your standard issue space blaster. You engage your gravity boots and quickly notice what appears to be a naturally formed entryway not too far from where you landed. That's your ticket to the heart of the asteroid. You bravely take the plunge through the entrance, your helmet's headlights shining the way.</p>
		<p>Surprisingly, the corridor you found yourself walking through wasn't as complicated as you were expecting it to be. Instead of a winding series or pathways, it ended up being straight and short with only a single turn in between. Either way, it led you into a gigantic cavern filled with beautiful crystals and precious metals lining the walls like nothing you've ever seen before!</p>
		<p>You pull up your suit's built in communication module on your wrist and attempt to contact your colony, but you have no signal. Just like the service deadzones that ravage the Earth, the asteroid has no access to the outside solar system. You shut off your headlights to see if that makes any difference, and it actually does!... but not with your communications.</p>
		<p>The cavern remains illuminated around you. You wonder if the materials could have absorbed the light, but there turns out to be another source of light moving around with you. Calling upon your extensive training, you silently dive back into the corridor with your hand hovering over your blaster. Peeking around the corner, you scan the cavern to find another lifeform dwelling inside, carrying a box filled with materials that it must have just finished extracting.</p>
		<p>Studying the lifeform from afar, it is humanoid in shape and stature, resembling that of the typical alien creatures from the horror movies of decades gone by. The big-eyed, green-skinned being saunters through the cavern, stepping over small crystals budding out of the floor. It has yet to detect your presense, and your suit's audio receptors pick up the creature's muttering to itself, which conveniently happens to be in a language you can understand. If it wasn't already so stereotypical in appearance, you might have actually believed it was real.</p>
		<p>The "alien" is taking valuable resources that would prove fruitful for your colony, and your academy training has taught you that you have the upper hand in this situation. Now might be a good time to do something...</p>
