		<p>You figure that the alien is <i>probably</i> friendly enough, so you step out from your hiding spot and approach it. You call out a greeting in the language you think you share, and the alien swivels its head around on a dime to look at you. Before you can get another word out, it lets out a shrill alarm from its tiny mouth. It rapidly stands to its feet and lunges at you, taking hold of your shoulders in an iron grip. You try to shake away, but its grasp only gets tighter and tighter.</p>
		<p>It stops shrieking, but you still hear an alarm somewhere behind you. Suddenly, the alien quickly turns you around to show you a merry band of space pirates aiming their blasters at you. None of them are wearing any kind of suit like yours, but they're very clearly human. You vainly attempt to greet them as you greeted the alien, but one of them grabs you and starts dragging you behind him.</p>
		<p>You and your body unwillingly comply with their use of force as they drag you through an open doorway and into an elevator. As you're set down in your knees, the alien enters into the elevator with you all, turning to press a short sequences of buttons on the keypad. The doors quietly close as the elevator car begins to rise up to who knows where.</p>
		<p>No one around you says a word, and the droning of the elevator's hydraulics are starting to get on your nerves. You begin to wonder if it'd be worth breaking the silence to try easing the tension and fill the air with a different sound. You also wonder if it'd be worth putting your academy training to good use to turn the situation in your favor...</p>
