	<section>
		<p>Emerging from the natural tendency to reflect on our lives and daily decisions, we often wonder what the world might be like if only we had made different choices. At times we consider the big decisions, other times the small things, and yet as much as we might like to ponder the alternative outcomes, the only productive recourse available to us is to learn and grow from our experiences.</p>
		<p>Although the amount of control that we possess over our destinies might seem like it's next to nothing, the realm of fiction has no such limitation. We can become the authors of whatever story we please, and among them is the unique brand of "Choose Your Own Adventure" storytelling, a specially crafted genre where the readers themselves are given agency over the events. And the best part? You can always go back and make new choices to experience something fresh.</p>
		<p>This website features two standalone short stories utilizing first-person and second-person perspectives respectively. Choices will be presented at the bottom of the page, as well as the option to return to the last possible story juncture if you wish to try another path. Once a storyline is completed, you may return to the last juncture or to the beginning of the story to try another path.</p>
		<p>These are the tales of the mundane made extraordinary. The choice is now yours.</p>
