		<p>My fear easily overcame me. I didn't want to stick around to see what party tricks she had in store, so I slowly backed away and ditched them through the other office doorway, bolting up the lane as fast as I could. Right as I made it out of the underground and up into the parking lot, a heard a deafening blast behind me and felt a wave of heat rush out of the garage. I was knocked down to the ground, pushing myself back up to keep running.</p>
		<p>I made it to my own car sitting at the far end of the parking lot. It was a beat-up jalopy that had certainly seen better days 15 or 20 years ago and was desperately clinging on for however many more miles I could squeeze out of it. I wasted no time driving it out of there, watching smoke billow out from the underground in my rearview mirrors.</p>
		<p>I called my boss the following morning—which is to say a few hours later—and let him know that I left work early due to an emergency. I filled him in on the situation and what happened, to which he was very understanding of. He let me know he would try his best to keep me out of any legal trouble and that he would pay me for the full night, as well as for the rest of the week.</p>
		<p>Needless to say, I was going to be out of a job for a while.</p>
