		<p>The boss raises an eyebrow at you, prompting your response. Without another thought, you accept his offer. A swashbuckling smiles creeps onto his face as he clasps a rigid hand on your shoulder. He welcomes you aboard with an ecstatic glee that you've never seen from someone in such an authoritative position. You look around and see the crew smiling at you, too—sans the alien, but you were never going to get much out of it anyway.</p>
		<p>The boss personally gives you a tour of the asteroid, showing you everything from the storage facility, the barracks, the entertainment center, and the mining operation, which you only saw a snippet of. Not only is it resource rich, but molecular makeup of the asteroid also makes it the perfect place for growing crops, which are grown both on the surface above and in farming bays built inside the asteroid's core.</p>
		<p>Your last stop is the kitchen, and as soon as the elevator doors open, a group of aliens immediately begin to stare at you. The boss waves a hand at them, and they return to work just as quickly. He turns back to you and hands you a chef's hat, telling you that you'll start with something simple and work your way up the proverbial ladder.</p>
		<p>You never envisioned yourself as particularly well inclined towards cooking—your bunkmates back at the academy could testify to that—but the boss is confident that tutelage from his alien chefs would bring you up to speed rather quickly. You question to yourself why he needs a human cook if he already has a retinue of galazy-class chefs at his disposal, but you figure your fellow man could probably use a little taste of home every once in a while. You don the hat atop your head and prepare yourself for a new life out in the final frontier.</p>
