		<p>You've already had enough fun for one day, so you return to your ship and retrieve a laser cutter and a large container, circling back to the cavern with you tools in tow. You take a gander all around you and decide that the shiny yellow metal in the wall closest to you is probably a good place to start. You turn on the laser cutter and bring the short beam close to the smoothest chunk you see.</p>
		<p>You carve out the golden material into a nice block, yanking it out as hard as you can. It falls out of your hand and clatters to the floor, chipping off a sliver of a small crystal that was close to your feet. You retrieve both items and place them in your container before shuffling over to the next most valuable material in the wall.</p>
		<p>This process continues for several minutes until you're confident that you've retrieved every type of material in the cavern. You drag the filled container back aboard your ship, as well as the broken mechanical body of one of the robot aliens. Satisfied with your haul, you quietly leave the asteroid, making sure to leave a tracker on the space rock before you depart.</p>
		<p>You safely return to base and meet with your superiors. You inform them of the battle between you and the mysterious robot aliens, as well as you retrieval of not only the materials, but the remains of one such robot. They're quite impressed with your work, and with the materials that you absconded with, the plan is to have them processed through a industrial-grade cloning machine for reproduction. As for the robot alien, the remains will be sent to a lab for further study in the intricacies and dynamics of how it came to be constructed. The hypothesis is that it's most likely of human origin, but no one is sure if they'll be able to figure out <i>who</i> exactly built it. Either way, your mission has been considered a resounding success. Great work, cadet!</p>
