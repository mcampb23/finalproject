		<p>In the summer before Jason Cooper’s junior year of high school, he found himself employed at a beachside cabana called The Surf Shack. It was part of a chain of stores littered next to the boardwalk with a building on every other block, all sharing the same name and owned by the same sleazy company. However, the place Jason worked at was quite different from the rest.</p>
		<p>Indeed, after half an hour of what he described to himself as “research,” he was sure that his chosen cabana was where he wanted to work. In keeping track of the traffic that came and went, he had discovered that this particular store seemed to have a higher density of female customers compared to other locations. In reality, he had no actual way of knowing the overall consumer demographics of each store from the bench on the boardwalk he chose as his scouting spot. Still, he was confident that he had hit the jackpot, and so Jason quickly applied for his first job if for no other reason than to meet some bodacious babes.</p>
		<p>Jason was trained by a proud college dropout named Dustin, who had learned enough from his time in pursuit of a degree in agronomy to grow weed in his room. He had that typical surfer vibe about him with shaggy hair, long stubble, and the faint scent of dope on his clothes. In Jason’s eyes, Dustin was a prime role model thanks to his unusual popularity with the ladies. During his training, Jason saw just how many girls flirted with the stoner in the store. Dustin was so cool about it, his only reply to them was, “Hey. Here’s the stuff,” as he slid a bag of grass over the counter.</p>
		<p>It wasn’t long at all before Jason was able to man the surf shack on his own. He also hadn’t seen Dustin for about a week, but Jason figured that he was just on vacation. The shack itself was home to many of the typical beach-faring amenities, like expired sunscreen, sandy beach toys, and cheap surfboards, all accompanied by the typical latest hits blaring from a radio in the corner. As far as shops on the beach went, it wasn’t remarkable whatsoever, but the lingering smell of pot in the air made Jason feel warm and fuzzy inside, like this was where he belonged.</p>

		<p>The shack’s lone coastal ceiling fan slowly spun around, a sad creak echoing out with every rotation of the blades. Light from the setting sun leaked through the front windows and the open door, illuminating the shelves in a soft, orange glow. Behind the counter, Jason reclined in a beach chair with his feet kicked up, snoozing under his standard-issue straw hat. A sports magazine rested in his lap, open to a page about a debate on whether American football should be renamed to soccer in other countries for the sake of parity.</p>
