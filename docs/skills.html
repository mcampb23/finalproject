		<p>There's no better time than now to give it all you've got. You wait for the most opportune moment, and deftly swing your leg around you to trip the men behind you. Your foot connects with an ankle and it doesn't go any further than that. Their anti-gravity boots do well to keep them tethered to the ground. You coyly glance up at the man whose ankle you kicked, and he stares down at you disapprovingly. There's no malice or hatred in his eyes, just the kind of look saying to you that you could have done so much better.</p>
		<p>The elevator finally brings you to the what you can only assume to be the control center. As you more or less expected, it's a rocky room filled with various computers and control panels lining the walls and systematically placed around the floor of the chamber. The men lift you up by your armpits and drag you to a man standing at the other end of the chamber.He stares out of the glass placed within the rock and into the abyss of space on the other side, slowly turning to see what the commotion is about. This man, who must be the boss, looks like a rather scary fellow. He's dressed in a military uniform not too dissimilar to what your drill sergeants wore back at the academy.</p>
		<p>The pirates inform the boss of your intrusion and your attempt to steal their materials. He looks down on you with a steel gaze, a sight you've seen many times before from your academy drill sergeants. He returns his attention back to his men and tilts his head to signal to them something you can only assume is bad news for you. They haul you away from the boss and towards another doorway. The doors open to reveal a small cabin housing what appears to be an escape pod. They slide the hatch open and toss you inside, closing it behind you before you have a chance to stick your foot in between the door. You peek into the tiny porthole and watch the men leave, although one of them stays behind to activate the escape pod for you. After a moment, he salutes you goodbye and leaves the cabin.</p>
		<p>Your suit's sensors indicate to you that the pod is beginning to pressurize. That would normally happen on the outside before the pod is ejected, so for it to happen on the inside... well, you quickly learn the answer as you're jetted out into the vacuum of space. In classic pirate fashion, you were just shot of a cannon.</p>
		<p>Your body flips over and over, and you see the asteroid flying farther and farther away every time you turn over. Before you know it, the asteroid is a speck in the distance. You activate your suit's zero-gravity stabilizers and attempt to get yourself upright... as best as you can in space, anyway. Thankfully, you can actually get some signal out here, so you give your ship a call to run the rendevous procedures...  at least you would if your ship wasn't still stuck in the asteroid's dead zone.</p>
		<p> With no other options left, you contact your superiors and inform them of your failed mission. However, you were able to gather intel about the asteroid that could prove helpful to the greater policing authorities, so your endeavor wasn't completely for naught. They instruct you to return to base for further debriefing.</p>
		<p>You're more than happy to oblige their request... assuming they can provide you with a ride back home.</p>
