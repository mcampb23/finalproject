	<article class="carwash">
		<p>I didn't want to get in the way of everyone's merriment, so I wandered over to the front desk, only to find that the guy working there was somehow fast alseep amidst all the noise going on around him. I rang the bell on the counter, but he failed to stir. I rang it again, and again, and again until I was just constantly dinging it. Eventually, he arose from his slumber and yawned, sitting himself upright to get back to work.</p>
		<blockquote>"Hey, are you alive?" I asked him.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Ugh... barely," he mumbled. "Can I... help you?"</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Yeah, when you were awake, you didn't happen to see a tall, pretty woman come through here? Wearing red? Looks like her name might be Carmen or something like that?"</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Uh... I don't think so..."</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"How long have you been sleeping here?"</blockquote>
		<p>The guy rubbed his eyes and took a look at the time on the computer screen in front of him. After a moment to figure out what point in time he was living in, he looked back at me.</p>
		<blockquote>"I think... I think I must've nodded off about a couple hours ago. Maybe."</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"I'm glad you got your nap in then. Good for you," I chided.</blockquote>
		<p>I turned around and ran towards one of the staircases in the foyer. I scrambled up the stairs as fast as I could and raced over to the balcony overlooking the rest of the room. Scanning the crowd, it was nearly impossible to figure out who anyone was; every body was so close and clustered together that it put rock concert audiences to shame. I glanced over every edge and corner until I finally found my culprit sneaking away through the backroom I had come from.</p>
		<p>Without another moment to lose, I hopped onto the banister and slid my way down to the main floor, jumping off right at the end and using the momentum to sprint through the crowd and out of the building. If she was using the utility elevator like I thought she was, then my best option was to go out and around through the lanes to catch her.</p>
		<p>I made it back into the garage just as she was stepping into her car. She closed the door, and I slammed my hands onto the hood to keep her from leaving... not that it would actually stop the car, but it wouldn't look very good on her car to have a different shade of red plastered over the paint job.</p>
		<blockquote>"What in the world are you doing?" she yelled at me as she opened the driver's window and stuck out her head.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"You... you have..." I struggled for breath. "You got something in there that could hurt a lot of people."</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"What are you...? Oh. So it was <i>you</i> that turned off my car."</blockquote>
		<p>She opened up the door and stood out of the car, closing it behind her with a soft thunk. She clomped her high-heeled stompers over to me and grabbed my by the chin, tilting my head up to look at her. She had a nasty, wicked look in her eyes like that of a witch.</p>
		<blockquote>"What are you so worried about, Ava?" her smooth words carressed my ears. "What concern is it to you what I do with my belongings?"</blockquote>
		<p>I didn't have a good comeback to that since I didn't really care what she did with her stuff as long as it wasn't affecting me.</p>
		<blockquote>"Here's what you're gonna do for me," she continued on. "You're gonna let me leave, and then you're gonna forget everything that you saw tonight. Don't call the police. Don't call a private investigator. If I find out they're looking for me, you'll be the first person I come after. Understand?"</blockquote>
		<p>I understood her completely, but I didn't want to admit it.</p>
		<blockquote>"I said... do you understand? Ava?"</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Yeah, yeah, I got it," I conceded.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Good. I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I'll see you never, darling."</blockquote>
		<p>She finally let me go, and I had no choice but to let her go, too. She raced out of the underground and off into the night. I ambled back into the office and sat down at the table, taking a remote laid on top of the CRT monitor and rewinding the camera feeds. Studying the footage from both cameras, I was able to get her license plate... except it was completely blacked out. She had a dark film cover over both of her tags, so it came out as completely blanked in the footage.</p>
		<p>Still... if that car wasn't just a rental or a getaway, then the appropriate authorities could use that information to track her down... not to mention the footage of her moving the cone out of the way.</p>
