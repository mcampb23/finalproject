		<p>The boss raises an eyebrow at you, prompting your response. As much as you might think the pirate's life is for you, you responsibly decline the boss' offer. He shrugs, but is completely understanding that his line of work isn't for the faint of heart like yourself. Before he has the chance to send you off on your way, you throw in an offer of your own. You don't want to return to your superiors empty-handed, so you ask if you might be able to take back some samples of the asteroid's materials.</p>
		<p>The boss looks at you like you've grown a second head for a moment, but he decides that it wouldn't hurt to share. He might be a thief, but at least he isn't selfish. He glances over at the alien and nods to it before bidding you farewell. The alien taps you on the shoulder, inviting you to follow. You cautiously do so, and the two of you board the elevator. The ride takes you down to the lowest level of the asteroid, where you're greeted by the storage facility. It's chock full of precious crystals and loads of valuable metals; it's a certifiable treasure trove.</p>
		<p>You patiently wait as the alien goes collecting small bits of the mateirals here and there from all around the facility. Before you know it, it hands you a medium-sized container housing a small piece of each crystal and metal that's been mined from the asteroid. You take it and almost drop it due to how heavy it is. You activate your suit's power-lifting module and tuck it safely under your arm. You thank the alien for its time and return to the elevator, and subsequently your ship. You blast off away from the asteroid, making sure to attach a tracking signal to it before you go, and return to base with knowledge and precious cargo.</p>
		<p>You meet with your superiors and give them the container, which they're astonished at how you managed to secure. You recount your mission to them and how the asteroid is actually a great big spaceship in disguise. Not only that, but you met with the captain of that ship, the boss of a small band of pirates, who was part of the Mars colony before pulling a mutiny. They mention that they've heard rumors about such a cutthroat sailing out there in the galaxy, and are even more bewildered that you managed to survive. Either way, with the materials that were given to you, the plan is to have them processed through a industrial-grade cloning machine for reproduction.</p>
		<p>Your mission has been considered a resounding success. Although the asteroid and its crew are still at large, you were still able to accomplish your goals. Great work, cadet!</p>
