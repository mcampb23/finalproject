	<article class="space">
		<p>The inner clean freak in you says that the mess isn't going to clean itself, but you're not really concerned about that at the moment. You step over the rubble and robot remains and jump into the elevator, letting the doors close with a soft <i>thunk</i>. There's an old 10-digit keypad in front of you, beckoning you to press its buttons. You're not as familiar with this kind of technology as you think you are, so you press the 9 key a bunch of times and pray it takes you to the top floor. You feel the elevator car rumble to life and the gravity ever so slightly shift under your feet as it begins to take you up.</p>
		<p>It is an agonizingly slow and painfully boring ride. You have no idea how the robot aliens made it to the cavern so fast in this hunk of junk, not unless they ditched the car and jumped down the shaft. Eventually, after the most excruciating 2 minutes of your life, you somehow make it to what must be the top floor. You only know this because the car crashed into the ceiling trying to go higher, which it's still attempting to do. You pry the doors open and step through the gap to enter what can only be the control center. As you more or less expected, it's a rocky room filled with various computers and control panels lining the walls and systematically placed around the floor of the chamber.</p>
		<p>There are a handful of real, living humans scattered about the room tending to various spaceship duties. On the far side of the room is a man staring out of the glass placed within the rock and into the abyss of space on the other side. He and the rest of the men in the room slowly turn to see what the commotion is about, watching as you shake your leg free from the gap in the door. You eventually get yourself free and casually meet eyes with everyone else. No one is wearing a suit like yours, so you now you're the odd one out. The man on the opposite side of the chamber, who must be the boss, looks like a rather scary fellow. He's dressed in a military uniform not too dissimilar to what your drill sergeants wore back at the academy.</p>
		<p>The boss sternly asks who you are and what you're doing here, so you politely inform him of your reconnaissance mission and what your intentions are. He seems none too pleased about your less than cordial and untelegraphed arrival, but you counter that you had no idea there were humans who made this asteroid their own space vessel. Besides, they're violating multiple galactic laws that you can't name off the top of your head, but you know they exist.</p>
		<p>He laughs it off and instructs his men to throw you overboard, and so they all get up and begin making their way toward you as the boss turns back to his abyss-watching activity. You have no easy escape this time, so you've got to make a move, and quick.</p>
