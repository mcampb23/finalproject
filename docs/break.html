		<p>You take a moment to remember your best joke from when you used to do comedy routines back in high school, and the perfect line comes to mind. You clear your throat and cautiously begin to talk. The alien stays as still as a statue, and you're not sure if your captors are even paying attention, but you confidently make it to the punchline without a single stutter. Unfortunately, the sound of the elevator continues to to drone on.</p>
		<p>Your heart sinks at the crowd's reception, and so you slump down a little lower than you already were. You think you hear what sounds like the elevator hitting some kind of bump, but you don't feel anything. Then you hear it again. It's someone's chuckle.</p>
		<p>The amused pirate behind you starts to chuckle a litte louder until his mates join in, and you realize that you've got the whole squad laughing. They pull you back up to your feet and take your helmet off. You panic for a moment before you take in a fresh gulp of asteroid air, which is a lot tastier than the oxygen that was being recycled throughout your suit. The pirates ask you to tell the joke again, and so you accept their request and fulfill it to their satisfaction.</p>
		<p>The whole car is filled with laughter—which the alien does not contribute to at all—until you finally reach what can only be the control center. As you more or less expected, it's a rocky room filled with various computers and control panels lining the walls and systematically placed around the floor of the chamber. The hysterics flood out of the elevator car and into the control center, and the pirates joyfully pat you on the back to go forward.</p>
		<p>They announce their presense to the man standing at the other end of the chamber. He stares out of the glass placed within the rock and into the abyss of space on the other side, slowly turning to see what the commotion is about. This man, who must be the boss, looks like a rather scary fellow. He's dressed in a military uniform not too dissimilar to what your drill sergeants wore back at the academy. The pirates inform the boss of your intrusion, but your joke was so funny that they almost forgot about what they caught you doing.</p>
		<p>Instead of asking about why you're even here in the first place, the boss curiously asks to hear this joke of yours for himself. Not wanting to pass up another opportunity, you gladly tell it again, much to the delight of the men around you. The boss takes a minute to process what you've said before he starts snickering like a madman. The room is quickly filled with a jolly mood, and the boss is happy to pardon your trespass, although it's at this point when he inquires of your visit.</p>
		<p>You inform the boss about your mission and how you were tasked with discovering more about the untracked asteroid you now find yourself on, at least before you learned that it was already commandeered and occupied. Of course, you yourself would like to know how an asteroid like this came to be inhabited by this band of brigands. The boss is happy to tell you, and it turns out that you weren't the first to come scout this asteroid out.</p>
		<p>Like his clothing suggested, the boss was once an officer part of the lone Mars colony. You've heard plenty of stories about that place, and none of them good. The boss didn't agree with how things were being run and done there, so he recruited the few trustworthy men he knew and made a raid on the capital commander's base of operations. With things so poorly run and disorganized as they were, the boss and his men easily had run of the place, and so they absconded with as much equipment as they could store on board a cargo cruiser.</p>
		<p>The scanners they stole picked up on the resource-rich asteroid a few days after they ditched Mars, and it would have been the perfect place to hide from the law. Using a universal atmosphere creator, they installed it on the surface of the asteroid and turned it into a suitable place to survive. Taking the resources from within, they were able to sell the materials and buy what they needed to not only survive, but also turn the asteroid into a worthy spacefaring vessel.</p>
		<p>The boss pauses and takes a good, long look at you. He studies you from head to toe, yet you don't feel an ounce of anxiety. The boss remarks that he was like you once upon a time, and he worries about where you might be headed if you stick around with those hacks back on the Moon colony. He sees a lot of potential in you, and so he offers for you to join his crew. What do tell him?</p>
