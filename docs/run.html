		<p>Saving your own hide is more valauble than whatever space rocks they've got stashed away in here! You make a break for the exit as fast as you can, ducking behind cover here and there as you dodge the robots' blaster fire. Thankfully for you, they really aren't very good at aiming, even for a bunch of walking tin cans.</p>
		<p>You make it back to the corridor you came in from and bolt down the hallway as quickly as your legs will carry you. However, you hear the clanking of heavy metal feet coming after you, and you suddenly feel a wave of unbearable heat shoot right past your shoulder. It rips a hole in your suit and a small fire begins burning out. A stray bolt had ricocheted off the walls, but it was a good thing it only turned out to be a scrape... a hot, searing scrape, but just a scrape nonetheless.</p>
		<p>You hastily pat the fire out and continue running toward your ship. You wonder how you're even still able to breathe with a hole in your suit, but that's a question that will have to be answered in another visit. You stomp up the ramp and press a button to close it, looking through the shrinking sliver to see the robot aliens start unloading blaster fire on your ship's hull. However, you had intelligently invested in energy absorption shields when you purchased this vessel, so that'll save you a trip to the energy station to fuel up.</p>
		<p>You make it to the cockpit and activate the startup procedures. The ship roars to life, and you disengage the landing gear to fly out of there as fast as the ship will go. You reverse out of the cave and set your coordinates for home base, watching out of the window as the robots cease their attack and return to wherever they came from.</p>
		<p>You're able to safely make it back to your superiors in one piece, and they inquire about your mission. Well... there's not really much to tell them besides the fact that robot aliens seem to already have the run of the place, so it's probably not a good idea to try and go back there. You weren't able to return with anything besides that information, but your mission was considered a success... if having the whole ordeal taken off the record was considered successful.</p>
