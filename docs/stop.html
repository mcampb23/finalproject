	<article class="carwash">
		<p>I thought—or more accurately <i>knew</i>—that I was in a better position than the police officers to keep her from causing any more trouble than she already had. I tip-toed out of the office, putting a finger to my lips as the officers spotted me. I motioned with my hands to tell them she had a trigger hidden behind her hand, then pointed my thumb at the soap nozzle behind me. One of them just <i>barely</i> nodded his head to give me the go ahead, so I snuck over to the soap nozzle as quick as I could.</p>
		<p>I silently slid it off of the hooks and began creeping behind the lady in red. The officers had stopped advancing on her once I was just beginning to get close enough.</p>
		<blockquote>"What's the matter, boys?" she teased the officers. "Aren't you coming to arrest poor ol' me? Those guns aren't even loaded, are they?"</blockquote>
		<p>Neither of them said a word, waiting on me to make a move... and make a move I did. I slid beside her, aiming the soap nozzle straight at her face. The solution sprayed right into her eyes, and she screamed in pain and disgust. The trigger fell out of her hand, and I sat back up and dove forward to catch it.</p>
		<p>It landed safely in my hand, and the officers mobilized to pin her down and slap a nice pair of handcuffs around her spindly wrists. The bomb squad rushed in not a moment too soon, and I happily handed the trigger over to a man dressed in the bulkiest armor I had ever seen. Before I could stick around and gloat over the lady, the police escorted me out to safety alongside everyone else that was up in the hotel. Needless to say, I didn't finish my shift that night, but my boss was willing to pay me for the whole shift anyway.</p>
		<p>Come to find out, this lady in red was apparently a notorious international burgler, but her identity was a complete mystery. Law enforcement was able to link her to the rest of her crimes thanks to the money found in her car and her trademark way of wiring explosive devices. Thankfully for me, I didn't have to partake in any press coverage or legal drama afterward like I was dreading since they had more than enough evidence to get her convicted... so that was nice.</p>
