	<article class="space">
		<p>You remember back to your academy days and how your peers would always try their hands at old-fashioned gunslinger duels like the cowboys did in those western movies that came out before the alien movies. The only problem is that you lost every duel you ever legitimately tried since no one told you when to draw... but no one could beat you if they didn't know there was a duel happening in the first place.</p>
		<p>You take a slight step back and ready yourself to grab your blaster. The boss isn't like the robots downstairs, so you can't get away with too much violence like before. You're running out of time, so you whip out your blaster, flipping a switch on the side of the weapon to "paralyze" with your thumb as you hook your finger around the trigger and squeeze. With a well-timed hipfire, you paralyzing bolt flies across the room in under a second and shocks the boss into submission. The men around suddenly turn to see him fall to the floor unconscious.</p>
		<p>Before they can return their attention on you, you announce that they're all under arrest for... whatever it is that they're doing, which is probably illegal, and that you'll be taking this vessel to the appropriate authorities. The men quickly drop their blasters in fear, and having seen your impressive dueling skills, they're honorbound to respect your victory. You lock them up inside of a small chamber that seems to house some kind of escape pod, but you can have it tracked to wherever they go, so there's truly no escape for them.</p>
		<p>You take the helm at the captain's command console and begin to steer the asteroid-turned-spaceship back towards the Moon colony. You set the appropriate coordinates and wait for home base to come into view. You activate the docking procedures, but somehow there don't seem to be any. Your superiors come in over the intercom, asking what it is that you're doing. You inform them that you managed to take control of the asteroid and apprehend the crew, so you're returning now to complete the mission. They sound rather panicked about something, but it's probably nothing to be worried about.</p>
		<p>You take manual control of the asteroid and steer to the closest landing bay. The intercoms cut out, and you think you can vaguely see other ships beginning to leave the bay to make way for your arrival. You're grateful for how accomodating everyone seems to be for you, and you increase thrust to get there quickly so everyone else can dock again.</p> 
		<p> The only problem is that no one actually taught you how to land an asteroid.</p>
