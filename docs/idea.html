		<p>Trusting that I could pull it off, I doubled back into the crowd and searched for the bride and groom. Given that she was dressed entirely in white, as per typical wedding customs, I gently got her attention by tapping her on the shoulder. She turned to look at me, as did the rest of the crowd, and although an initial wave of slight disgust and fear crossed her face, she quickly hid it away.</p>
		<blockquote>"Yes? What can I help you with?" she asked tenderly.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"I'm sorry to bother you, miss... er, <i>missus</i>," I told her, "but would you happen to know that lady way over there? I think I saw her take something from your husband."</blockquote>
		<p>I pointed way over the crowd to direct the bride toward the lady in red, who was now briskly making her to her exit.</p>
		<blockquote>"Hold on," she mused. "Is that..?"</blockquote>
		<p>The bride detached herself from her group and strolled away, picking up her dress to give herself the room to run. I snuck away in the confusion before anyone had the chance to ask me who I was, floating nearby the bride as she went to hunt down the lady in red.</p>
		<blockquote>"Rebecca!" the bride called out.</blockquote>
		<p>The lady in red turned on a dime as the bride came face to face with her. She began talking to Rebecca very sternly. I didn't want either of them to see me, but that meant I couldn't hear their conversation from where I was hiding. Other people around me began to take notice until the whole of the room was watching their argument. The conversation ended with a swift slap to Rebecca's face and the bride taking away her handbag. With the whole room watching her now, and completely aware of it, the lady in red looked around in shock and embarrassment.</p>
		<p>She wasn't slow to take her leave, and she rushed out of the building through the front entrance. Meanwhile, I slipped away from the party and found my way to the utility elevator, taking a ride back down to my domain. As the doors slid open, I found the lady in red just getting back into her car, yet she stood there sulking for a moment before finally taking a seat inside. She started the car and drove off, money and explosives still inside the back of her vehicle.</p>
		<p>I returned to the office and picked up the phone, ready to dial the local police to let them know about the situation... yet I was apprehensive to do it. So instead, I waited until my shift was over and called my boss to tell him about it, to which he let me know that he would take care of it.</p>
		<p>As far as I was concerned, there was nothing left for me to worry about regarding the case of this Rebecca character, and even though I monitored the news every once in a while to see if she showed back up, the lady in red never returned.
