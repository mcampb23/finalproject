		<p>As much as I would have preferred to take care of the situation myself—and do it quietly, I might add—it was better that I contact the professionals. I hung up the soap nozzle back on the wall and ran into the office, grabbing the landline phone next to the CRTs and dialing 911. After a couple rings went through, the dispatcher picked up and answered.</p>
		<blockquote>"911, what's your emergency?" she asked on the other end of the line.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Yeah, hi, my name is Ava Victoria, and I just found a bomb at my workplace. Can you send, like, the police or a bomb squad or something?"</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Yes, ma'am. What's your location?" she said calmly.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"I'm working in the underground carwash at the big hotel on 18th street. I found the bomb in a car I was working on for a customer."</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Is the bomb armed?"</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"No, ma'am. Er... I don't think so. I hope not."</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Understood. Can you stay on the line for me?"</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Uh... well, I'm supposed to be washing her car, and I'm calling on a landline... I don't want to raise any suspicion, if you know what I mean?"</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Ava, I would recommend—"</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Okay, great! Glad you agree. I'll stall her when she comes back... and come in through the back way."</blockquote>
		<p>I left the reciever sitting on the table, the dispatcher's voice calling my name for me to come back, but I had a part to play that needed my attention. I retrieve the soap nozzle and covered the car as slowly and lazily as I could. By the time it was doused in the solution, I noticed the doors of the utility elevator open, and striding confidently towards me and the car was the lady in red. Seeing how much progress I still had left, she didn't appear too thrilled with my work ethic.</p>
		<blockquote>"I thought you would have been done by now," she complained.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"These things take time, ma'am," I bluffed. "Besides, you wanted the complete package, didn't you?"</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"No, I said I wanted a quick wash. Are you deaf?"</blockquote>
		<p>Just like all the other entitled rich folks I've come across, she was beginning to show her true colors when things were taking just a little too long.</p>
		<blockquote>"Oh! I must've misheard you, then. You have my apologies," I smiled in fake embarrassment.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Just hurry it up, please. I have other places to be," she groaned.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"I'll... try my best."</blockquote>
		<p>I traded the soap nozzle for the power washer and started rinsing off the car under the watchful eye of my impatient audience. I had to play the game with a delicate balance. If I worked too slow, and I risk the ire of my customer and the potentially ill consequences she'll dish out on me. If I worked too fast, then she'll be long gone before the authorities arrive, leaving me to explain why I ended up wasting their time.</p>
		<p>By the time I got around to the spoiler, her patience had finally reached a breaking point. Without so much as a word or warning, she grabbed my shoulder to turn me around, yanking the washer out of my hands and grabbing my collar to throw me into the office. Before I could protest, she pointed the nozzle at me and gave me a "don't mess with me" stare. She finished washing the car herself, somehow keeping herself completely dry and clean in the process. Once the car was rinsed off, she tossed the nozzle aside and walked around to the driver side.</p>
		<p>I could tell she wanted to say something else to me before she left, but she must've been way behind her schedule at that point because she ignored me and let herself into the coupe. She closed the door, and even though I couldn't see her through the windows, I could hear her say some sort of expletive about the car being off. The coupe rumbled to life and she floored it to get out of the garage as fast as she could, but not before I pressed the garage button next to the doorway.</p>
		<p>I heard tires squeal on one end of the garage as she stopped the car from crashing into the closing door. They squealed again as I peeked out of the office to see the car coming at me in reverse, and yet she suddenly stopped again. At the other end of the garage, red and blue lights were bouncing off of the walls as a police cruiser came rolling in.</p>
		<p>The driver side door of the coupe flew open, and the lady in red jumped out to make a break for it, but not before the police officers had their weapons drawn on her. She stopped in the middle of the garage and lackadaisically raised her hands into the air.</p>
		<p>As the officers slowly moved forward to apprehend her, I noticed a small cylinder hidden behind her hand. It was hanging from a thin golden line that could easily have been mistaken for a ring from the right angle. I didn't know what it was, but it couldn't have been anything good. She was ever so slightly waving her hand to nudge the cylinder closer to her thumb. If it was what I thought it was...
