		<p>I had only worked at this carwash for a few months, but working the night shift taught me how to deal with her type when they showed up.</p>
		<blockquote>"Look," I began. "If you can't pay upfront, then I can't do anything for you. Simple as that."</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Then how about I go ahead and do it myself if it's going to be that much of a problem?" she responded.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"I thought you had somewhere to be?" I retorted.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"And I would have been up there by now if you just let me go. There's nothing wrong with giving people a little leeway sometimes, little girl."</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"And there's nothing wrong with following the rules. So what's it gonna be?"</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"If that's how it's going to be, how about I just leave my car here? Trust me, I'll be back quicker than you think. No need to wash it... but if you want to, I won't stop you."</blockquote>
		<p>I couldn't help but sigh at how stubborn she was. Even my own mother wasn't this pushy. We clearly weren't getting anywhere...</p>
