	<article class="carwash">
		<p>I ultimately decided against it; no reason in creating extra work for myself, or extra hassle for a customer.</p>
		<p>I remembered that she asked for the quick wash, so I followed my usual routine of covering the car in soap, being prudent to get under the spoiler, too. Then I doused it with water and made sure that there wasn't a single bubble left over. I hung the nozzles back on their racks and pushed a button on the wall to activate the fans. They roared to life, but not before I was able to jump back into the office so they wouldn't blow me away. After a minute or so, they shut themselves off, leaving behind a freshly washed car that really didn't need it in the first place.</p>
		<p>The whole process only took me a few minutes maximum, and the lady reappeared just as the fans came to a full stop. As if right on cue, the doors of the utility elevator opened up, and she confidently stepped out. I peered out from the office as she gave me a seductive smile, reaching into her handbag and pulling out a slip of paper to hand to me. I accepted it as nonchalantly as I could, only to discover that it was check filled out with her signature and a five figure sum. It was enough to make even her sugar daddy blush.</p>
		<blockquote>"All you have to do is put your name on it," she assured me. "Consider that your tip... but only if my carwash is on the house."</blockquote>
		<p>I was instinctually about to tell her that we don't accept checks, but if it was really her tip like she said, I had no reason to deny it.</p>
		<blockquote>"Th-thank you!" I stuttered, almost embarrassed. "This is... way too much for someone like me."</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Don't worry about it, honey," she replied. "A cutie like you shouldn't be working down in a dungeon like this."</blockquote>
		<p>I happened to quite like my job, but I wouldn't deny that there were probably some better opportunities I had access to. Still, I wondered how it came to be that she had so much money to just throw around like that. The only way I could see it working is if she robbed banks or businesses without ever leaving a trace.</p>
		<p>As she opened the car door and placed her high-heeled toes inside, she gave me one last charming look.</p>
		<blockquote>"When do you get off of work?" she inquired of me.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Oh, uh... I get off at 5," I told her.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Then make sure you cash that as soon as you get off, alright?"</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Why's that?"</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"It's just something with my bank and how they do transactions. It's not an issue as long as you do it before 6."</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"The IRS isn't gonna come and snatch me away, are they?"</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Ha!" she laughed. "No, I'll make sure they don't."</blockquote>
		<p>With that, she waggled her fingers goodbye and ducked into the car, silently closing the door and driving off rather quickly. I took another look at the check and studied the numbers. If I were to work every single night for the whole year, what I would make washing cars wouldn't even be <i>half</i> of what was on that slip of paper. I could've quit then and there and actually afford to go to college or start my own carwashing business, or go to college to learn how to start a carwashing business.</p>
		<p>I tucked the check away into my pocket and went to sit down in the office. The rest of the night went without another customer, and I did what the lady told me to do by morning. A day or so later, I saw the money roll into my bank account without any kind of hassle or unexpected visit from the IRS. She was true to her word, and just as quickly as we had crossed paths, I never saw her again.</p>
