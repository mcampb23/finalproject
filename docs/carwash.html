		<p>Have you ever thought about what it might be like to work at a 24/7 carwash? Not the automatic, touch and go kind, but the hands and knees, scrub till you're done kind. The place I work at can afford to operate every hour of every day, but can’t afford to automate the process a little bit… or get some more people for that matter, so I always end up working the night shift by myself.</p>
		<p>It’s set underneath a fancy hotel in the upper-class part of the city. Don't think about the logistics of that because I can't figure it out either. I’m sure it sees a little more traffic in the day, but it’s totally dead at night. Despite that, I do meet the occasional customer, all of which consist of bougie rich folks, illegal street racers, and the random road warrior running on nothing but caffeine and a dream. Why any of them would need to get their cars cleaned up at 2 or 3 in the morning is frankly beyond me—although I understand the racers—but I keep quiet most of the time and do the work.</p>
		<p>My boss tells me it’s state law that carwashes like ours are required to have “attendants” to clean your car for you, so when people ask me why they can’t do it themselves, I relay the same line that he gave me. The best part is that every single one of them buys it. I already know for a fact that the law my boss is thinking about only applies to gas stations, and our state doesn’t even have that law. I’ve resigned to seeing it as his clever way to help me get some tips, but I’ve yet to see it come to fruition.</p>
		<p>I sit in a little office nestled between two lanes that each run in either direction, making it feel like I'm operating a toll booth, especially with the garage door buttons next to the doorways that I never touch. Although I've never seen anyone use it, nor have I had to use it myself, there's a utility elevator opposite to the office, but it's so old that I doubt if it even works. I have two small CRT monitors on the table that show me the camera feed for both lanes so I can see when someone comes rolling down the slope and into my underground. As they come in, the cars stop on top of a metal grate where the excess water can drain into. The walls are kitted out with soaps and power washers that I always have to tell people not to touch, as per the “law.” It’s all a fairly straightforward operation; they pay the service fee up front, I spray the car with soap, rinse it off with water, dry it with the big fans built into the ceiling, they drive off, and then I wait another two or three hours for the next customer, give or take.</p>
		<p>Most people only ever come in from one lane since they don't want to have to drive all the way around the building, so I keep one monitor alive on the open lane and use the other one for video games. I even put up a cone in the unused lane at the start of my shift so I know that I won't have to worry about anyone coming in from that way. I get paid for having nothing better to do, so I might as well make the most of it. This arrangement goes well for me pretty much all of the time, but then some lady had the audicity to move my cone out of the way and let herself in.</p>
		<p>It was right at midnight—12:00 AM on the dot—when she rolled in. I obviously didn't see her on the camera because she arrived in the lane I had blocked off. Bright LED headlights came blaring in behind me, so I paused my game and leaned my head back to see who was coming. Rolling in was an expensive red coupe that I could only ever dream of buying, fitted with a fancy spoiler and blackout windows. Like, we're talking something in the 6-figure range that would take most people 10 years just to be able to cover a fraction of the cost.</p>
		<p>I stepped out of the office and watched the coupe quickly come to a park over the cleaning zone, and out of the car comes the most drop-dead gorgeous brunette I had ever seen. She was conspicuously attired in a V-neck, thigh-high sequined dress matching the color of her car, adorned in the appropraitely tall high heels and equipped with a cute handbag strapped over her shoulder. The jealousy of women everywhere is what she was, and she probably had ten different men wrapped around each of her slender fingers.</p>
		<blockquote>"How are you, sweetheart?" she asked me as she closed the door, leaving the car running.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"I'm... fine," I answered, scratching the back of my neck. "What can I do for you?"</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"I just need a quick wash done," she said in an endearing tone. "Would you be able to take care of that for me while I run upstairs real quick? I'll pay you right after, I promise."</blockquote>
		<p>As she fluttered her eyelashes at me, I noticed her subtly glance down at my nametag in between her blinks. Most people make it pretty obvious by squinting down at it, but not her. Still, despite it being something I caught in her behavior, that wasn't the act I was concerned with at the moment.</p>
		<blockquote>"I'm sorry, miss, but we take payment upfront here," I told her. "That's part of our policy."</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Well, I don't suppose you might give me a little wiggle room to work with, would you Ava? It's very urgent."</blockquote>
		<p>I had dealt with customers like her countless times before...</p>
