		<p>I wasn't going to let her get away while I still had her in my sight. I kept up with her as best as I could, grabbing for her bag again just as we got away from the rest of the crowd.</p>
		<blockquote>"Leave me alone, little girl!" she hissed. "Or so help me, I will take this place down with you in it!"</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Go ahead!" I said defiantly. "I'm not gonna let you do what you're doing."</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Is that right?" she questioned. "Can you stop this?"</blockquote>
		<p>She reached into her bag and pulled out a small cylinder. She opened up the cap to reveal a small button, which she firmly pressed without so much as a moment of hesitation. From down below in the underground, I could feel the ground rumble with enormous force. The lady in red pulled herself away from my grip and darted out of the building just as the crowd around us was growing wise to the situation.</p>
		<p>Everyone began to panic, and they started to disperse around the room, nearly scrambling over each other to run out of the hotel. I lost where the lady in red went; she used the chaos she created to make herself disappear. I had no other choice but to evacuate with everybody else, the screams and alarms ringing in my ears.</p>
		<p>I found myself standing outside in the parking lot, watching as the police and fire department surrounded the building. I wasn't going to be leaving anytime soon, so all I could so was watch and wait for the chaos to settle. As if attuned to my very plight, my boss appeared on the scene, taking in the smoking scenery coming out from his beautiful business. He eventually found me where I was hanging around my jalopy of a car, and so I let him know what happened.</p>
		<p>He was very understanding about it, offering to pay me for the rest of the night, and seeing as how I was going to be out of a job for the forseeable future, he also said he would compensate me for the following week, too. He was curious about who this lady in red was, but we weren't going to be figuring that out anytime soon.</p>
