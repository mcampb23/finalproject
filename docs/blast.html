		<p>You remember back to your old academy days how your peers would try to see who could draw the fastest out of everyone, imitating the cowboys from old western movies. Fortunately for you, it was a skill that you had practiced since you were but a wee tyke who didn't even know how to tie their own shoes. You knew what your priorities were.</p>
		<p>You take a slight step back and ready yourself to grab your blaster. The men surrounding you aren't like the robots downstairs, so you can't get away with too much violence like before. You're running out of time, so you whip out your blaster, flipping a switch on the side of the weapon to "paralyze" with your thumb as you hook your finger around the trigger and squeeze.</p>
		<p>You spray your shots around you, shocking every last man around you except for the boss. The bodies fall to the floor, leaving only you and the boss. He slowly turns back around to stare at you, offering a slight smirk to say that he's actually somewhat impressed with you. He asks you again what your mission is, so you oblige and inform the boss about it. You tell him again how you were tasked with discovering more about the untracked asteroid you now find yourself on, at least before you learned that it was already commandeered and occupied. Of course, you yourself would like to know how an asteroid like this came to be inhabited. The boss is happy to tell you, and it turns out that you weren't the first to come scout this asteroid out.</p>
		<p>Like his clothing suggested, the boss was once an officer part of the lone Mars colony. You've heard plenty of stories about that place, and none of them good. The boss didn't agree with how things were being run and done there, so he recruited the few trustworthy men he knew and made a raid on the capital commander's base of operations. With things so poorly run and disorganized as they were, the boss and his men easily had run of the place, and so they absconded with as much equipment as they could store on board a cargo cruiser.</p>
		<p>The scanners they stole picked up on the resource-rich asteroid a few days after they ditched Mars, and it would have been the perfect place to hide from the law. Using a universal atmosphere creator, they installed it on the surface of the asteroid and turned it into a suitable place to survive. Taking the resources from within, they were able to sell the materials and buy what they needed to not only survive, but also turn the asteroid into a worthy spacefaring vessel.</p>
		<p>You can tell that he's rather proud of what he's accomplished, so he's not going to be very willing to let that all go. You tell him that if he willingly surrenders, you'll ensure that he can get away with a light punishment, or as light of a punishment as you can haggle down to. For a moment, he seems to be considering the proposition, but then he laughs the notion away. Well, at least you tried to bargain.</p>
		<p>With no other options, you inform him that he and his men are under arrest, to which he laughs the notion away. He continues to laugh until you feel like you're about to start laughing with him. You let out a small chuckle, to which the boss responds by pulling out his own blaster and shooting you right in the chest. An unbearable heats sears into your flesh, and you can feel your suit beginning to melt into your skin. Smoke filters out of the hole, and you feel your strength beginning to leave you. Everything begins to go numb, and then you finally collapse to the floor.</p>
		<p>You feel an overwhelming presense lean over you as your consciousness starts to fade, and the last thing you hear is the whisper of the boss telling you about some great plans he has for you.</p>
		<p>~</p>
		<p>You wake up without warning, and all of your previous pain is gone. Your eyes begin to adjust to your surroundings, and you can see <i>a lot</i> of your surroundings. You appear to be in some kind of kitchen, filled with the standard cooking utensils and ingredients that you would expect to find. You turn your head, and it rapidly swivels around so you can see behind you. Your eyes meet a mirror reflecting the image of the robot alien back at you, and the boss lowers the looking glass to give you a hearty smile. He laughs as he commands you to get back to work, which your body acknowledges and does so without any resistance, but against your will.</p>
		<p>You take a knife set down on the cutting board in front of you and begin slicing the carrots before you with the utmost precision.</p>
