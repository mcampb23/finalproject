		<p>Like the coward you believed that your academy peers thought you deep down to be, you lackadaisically watch the lifeform walk through the rest of the cavern and duck through another pathway in the wall. With the alien out of sight, you turn your headlights back on and slowly move back into the cavern and search for where the being disappeared to. However, it seems as though your optical receptors decieived you; the pathway you thought you saw is no longer there.</p>
		<p>You noticed that the alien wasn't wearing any kinds of gadgets or gizmos, so there was no way he could have just walked through the wall. Nonetheless, you attempt just that and stroll toward the rockface in front of you as if you might phase through it, but all that manages to slip through the cracks is a few of your brain cells. If he didn't phase through the wall, then the only alternative was that there must be a hidden door, and every hidden door <i>must</i> come with a hidden switch somewhere. Naval academy didn't teach you that, but it's just common sense.</p>
		<p>You brush your hands along the bumpy walls in the cavern in search of any hidden mechanism that could open the pathway, yet you only find yourself returning to where you started. You begin to bang and kick the wall in hopes that it might open for you, but again, no such luck is on your side.</p>
		<p>With your search reaching a dead end, the only option left to you now is to do as the alien did and collect the resources to bring back to base. You return to your ship and retrieve a laser cutter and a large container, circling back to the cavern with you tools in tow. You take a gander all around you and decide that the shiny yellow metal in the wall closest to you is probably a good place to start. You turn on the laser cutter and bring the short beam close to the smoothest chunk you see.</p>
		<p>You carve out the golden material into a nice block, yanking it out as hard as you can. It falls out of your hand and clatters to the floor, chipping off a sliver of a small crystal that was close to your feet. You retrieve both items and place them in your container before shuffling over to the next most valuable material in the wall.</p>
		<p>Right as you plunge the laser cutter into what looks like silver, something blunt and hard strikes your head from behind, forcing your helmet to crash into the wall in front of you, and thus your face into your visor, and you crumple over to the floor. You wearily turn your head towards the ceiling to see the alien leering over you, it's dark, cold, enormous eyes drilling deep into your soul.</p>
		<p>It reaches down and lifts you up to get a better look at you, or so you think. You see a strange-looking device come into your view, a device held within the alien's grasp. It bears a striking resemblence to tools used by government agents on Earth, but before you can question anything else in your head, a bright flash engulfs your vision.</p>
		<p>~</p>
		<p>You wake up to find yourself back on your ship, which is parked in your driveway at the Moon colony. You unbuckle yourself and take off your suit before your memory returns. You hastily start to search your space vessel for your tools, and you realize that they were placed neatly in the passenger seat. You open up the container, but the materials you mined are gone. Disappaointed at your own incompetence, you contact your superiors—and yes, you actually have signal this time—and inform them of the circumstances of your failed mission.</p>
		<p>In sharing your bewilderment about the situation, they end up just as bewildered as you are. Despite failing your first mission, your superiors see fit to give you a pass this time around. Perhaps it's out of pity at such a ridiculous story, but then again, their detectors didn't sense any lies coming from you, either.</p>
		<p>At least the alien had the decency to send you back home with your ship.</p>
