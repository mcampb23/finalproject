		<p>Street racers understand how hard they need to work to afford their passtime. Road warriors understand how long they need to stay awake to get to where they're going. They all respect what I do, but it's the rich folks that, as the stereotype would have it, don't give a rip about who you are or what you do as long as you do what they want. If time was really money, then I was wasting plenty of hers.</p>
		<blockquote>"Miss," I continued. "If you're not getting it washed, then you need to leave... with the car, I mean."</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Excuse me?" she said ever so slightly aghast. "I'm just asking for a small favor. What's the big deal?"</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Your favor is, uh... <i>incompatible</i> with our policy," I told her, somewhat pleased with my myself for using such a big word. "You can pay or you can take your car and leave. It's up to you."</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Ugh! You're wasting my <i>time</i>, little girl," she grumbled.</blockquote>
		<p>She reached into her handbag and pulled out a fancy wristwatch, an accessory that wasn't really in taste with the rest of her outfit. She <i>tsked</i> at the sight of the time and dropped it back in her bag, but not before giving me a dirty look contrary to her beauty.</p>
		<blockquote>"I missed my window," she said under her breath as she closed her mascara-heavy eyes in disappointment.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"What window?" I asked. "I could have cleaned it for you if you paid like you should have, y'know."</blockquote>
		<p>She stared at me for a while before she finally opened the driver's door and placed her high-heeled foot inside.</p>
		<blockquote>"I'm not done with you, Ava," she said as if to scare me.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>"Yeah, uh-huh, sure," I answered. "Come back when you can afford it."</blockquote>
		<p>She huffed at me and ducked into her car, slamming the door and driving off. After that, I put my cone back into it's rightful place and spent the rest of my shift without another interruption.</p>
